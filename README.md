# House-Price-Prediction
In this project, we will explore and build predictive models to estimate house prices in Ames, Iowa, using a dataset with 79 features that describe various characteristics of residential homes. The goal is to predict the final sale price for each home based on these features.

Problem Description When buyers think about purchasing their dream home, they often focus on elements like the number of bedrooms, the backyard, or the kitchen design. However, many other factors, such as the condition of the basement, the quality of the neighborhood, and even proximity to a railroad, play significant roles in determining a homeâ€™s final sale price. This dataset, compiled by Dean De Cock, provides an excellent opportunity to understand how these numerous variables impact price negotiations, beyond the most obvious features.

Objective The objective of this project is to build a regression model that predicts the sale price of homes using advanced machine learning techniques. For each house in the test set, we will predict its SalePrice based on the various explanatory variables provided in the dataset.

Dataset This dataset contains 79 explanatory variables, which capture information about the physical characteristics of the house, neighborhood, and overall quality. It is a great modern alternative to the famous Boston Housing dataset and provides more depth and complexity, allowing for creative feature engineering and the application of advanced regression models.
